The purpose of this profile is to provide national level agreement on core localised concepts. This profile does not force conformance to core localised concepts. It enables implementers and modellers to make their own rules, i.e. [profiling](http://hl7.org/fhir/profiling.html), about how to support these concepts for specific implementation needs.\n\nFor specific reporting of pathology or imaging services the more specific [AU Base Pathology Report](StructureDefinition-au-pathologyreport.html) or [AU Base Diagnostic Imaging Report](StructureDefinition-au-imagingreport.html) profiles would be preferred. This profile is suitable for any other diagnostic service reporting needs.","jurisdiction":[{"coding":[{"system":"urn:iso:std:iso:3166","code":"AU"}]}],"copyright":"HL7 Australia© 2018+; Licensed Under Creative Commons No Rights Reserved.","fhirVersion":"4.0.1","mapping":[{"identity":"workflow","uri":"http://hl7.org/fhir/workflow","name":"Workflow Pattern"},{"identity":"v2","uri":"http://hl7.org/v2","name":"HL7 v2 Mapping"},{"identity":"rim","uri":"http://hl7.org/v3","name":"RIM Mapping"},{"identity":"w5","uri":"http://hl7.org/fhir/fivews","name":"FiveWs Pattern Mapping"}],"kind":"resource","abstract":false,"type":"DiagnosticReport","baseDefinition":"http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DiagnosticReport","derivation":"constraint","snapshot":{"extension":[{"url":"http://hl7.org/fhir/tools/StructureDefinition/snapshot-base-version","valueString":"4.0.1"}],"element":[{"id":"DiagnosticReport","path":"DiagnosticReport","short":"A diagnostic report in an Australian healthcare context","definition":"The findings and interpretation of diagnostic  tests performed on patients, groups of patients, devices, and locations, and/or specimens derived from these.
